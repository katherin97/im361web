        <h1>Tsunamis</h1>
          <p>What are tsunamis?</p>
          <pre>Tsunamis, also known as sesimic sea waves, are a series of enormous waves that are created by an underwater disturbance, such</pre>
          <pre>as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. A tsunami can travel for hundreds of miles per hour in open</pre>
          <pre>ocean and smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet, or even more.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Where are they common?</p>
          <pre>Tsunamis can occur in all large bodies of water, but are more common in the Pacific Ocean. This is not only due to its size,</pre>
          <pre>but also due to the series of mountains, deep-ocean trenches, and the "ring of fire" (off the coastsd of Kamchatka, Japan; the</pre>
          <pre>Kuril Islands; Alaska and South America).</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>How are they detected?</p>
          <pre>Tsuanmis are detected using open-ocean buoys and by coastal tide gages. The information from these instruments are reported back</pre>
          <pre>in real time to tsunami warning centers (one in Alaska and another in Hawaii). Warning centers also use earthquake (seismic) data</pre>
          <pre>to estimate the strength of the tsunamis from the character of an earthquake, since seismic waves travel faster than tsunamis.</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when a Tsunai Threatens</h1>
          <p>Prepare Now</p>
          <pre>-If you live near, or regularly visit a castal area, learn about the risk of tsuanmis in the area. Some at-risk communities have</pre>
          <pre> maps with evacuation zones and routes.</pre>
          <pre>-Learn the signs if a potential tsunami, such as an earthquake, a loud roar from the ocean, or unusual ocean behavior, such as a</pre>
          <pre> sudden rise or wall of water, or a sudden drain of water.</pre>
          <pre>-Know and practice community evacuation plans and map out your routes from home, work, and play. Pick shelters 100 feet or more</pre>
          <pre> above sea level, and at least one mile inland.</pre>
          <pre>-Consider earthquake insurance and a flood insurance policy.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Survive During</p>
          <pre>-If you are in a tsunami area and there is an earthquake, first protect yourself from the earthquake.</pre>
          <pre>-When the shaking stops, if there are natural signs or official warnings of a tsunami, then move immediately to a safe place as</pre>
          <pre> high and as far inland as possible. Listen to the authorities, but do not wait for tsunami warnings and evacuation orders.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are outside of the tsunami hazard zone and recieve a warning, stay where you are unless officials tell yoou otherwise.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are in the water, then grab onto soemthing that floats, such as a raft, tree trunck, or door.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are in a boat, then face the direction of the waves and head out to sea. If you are in a harbor, then go inland.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Be Safe After</p>
          <pre>-Listen to local alerts and authorities for information on areas to avoid and shelter locations.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris. Water may also be deeper than it appears.</pre>
          <pre>-Be aware of the risk of electocution. Underground or downed power lines can electrically charge water.</pre>
          <pre>-Stay away from damaged buildings, roads, and bridges.</pre>
          <pre>-Document property damage with photographs. Conduct an inventory and contact your insurance company for assistance.</pre>
          <pre>-Save phone calls for emergencies.</pre>
