        <h1>Wildfires</h1>
          <p>What are wildfires?</p>
          <pre>Wildfires are uncontrolled blazes fueled by weather, wind, and dry underbrush. They can burn acres of land in mere minutes.</pre>
          <pre>On average, more than 100,000 wildfires clear between 4-5 million acres of land in the U.S. alone every year.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>How are they formed?</p>
          <pre>There must be three conditions present in order for a wildfire to burn: fuel, oxygen, and a heat source. Fuel is any flammable</pre>
          <pre>material surrounding a fire, air supplies the oxygen a fire needs to burn, while a heat source helps spark the wildfire and bring</pre>
          <pre>fuel to temperatures hot enough to ignite.</pre>
          <pre>Four out of five wildfires are caused by people, whether it's by leaving burning campfires or cigarettes. And while they can</pre>
          <pre>happen everywhere in the world, they are most common in the U.S. West, where heat, drought, and frequent thunderstorms create</pre>
          <pre>perfect wildfire conditions.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>How to fight them</p>
          <pre>To fight wildfires, firefighters deprive them from one or more the 3 elements needed. Tranditionally, this includes water dousing</pre>
          <pre>and spraying fire retardents to extiguish existing fires. It also includes clearing vegeitation to create firebreaks to starve a fire.</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when a Wildfire Threatens</h1>
          <p>Prepare Now</p>
          <pre>-Sign up for your community's warning system.</pre>
          <pre>-Know your community's evacuation plans and find several ways to leave the area. Drive the eveacuation routes and find shelter</pre>
          <pre> locations, as well as have a plan for pets and livestock.</pre>
          <pre>-Designate a room that can be closedd off from ouutside air. Close all doors and windows, and set up a portable air cleaner to keep</pre>
          <pre> indoor pollution levels low when smoky conditions exist.</pre>
          <pre>-Keep important documents in a fireproof, safe place. Create password-protected digital copies.</pre>
          <pre>-Use fire-resistant materials to build, renovate, or make repairs.</pre>
          <pre>-Find an outdoor water course with a hose that can reach any area of your property.</pre>
          <pre>-Create a fire-resistant zone that is free of leaves, debris, or flammable materials for at least 30 feet from your house.</pre>
          <pre>-Review insurance coverage to make sure it is enough to replace your property.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Survive During</p>
          <pre>-Evacuate immediately if authorities tell you to do so.</pre>
          <pre>-If trapped, then call 911 and give your location, but be aware that emergency response could be delayed or impossible. Turn on</pre>
          <pre> lights to help rescuers find you.</pre>
          <pre>-Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or your local alert system for current emergency information and instrucions.</pre>
          <pre>-Use a N95 mask to keep harmful particles out of the air you breathe.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are not ordered to evacuate but smoky conditions exist, stay inside a safe location or go to a community building where</pre>
          <pre> smoke levels are lower.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Be Safe After</p>
          <pre>-Listen to authorities to find out when it is safe to return, and whether water is safe to drink.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid hot ash, charred trees, smoldering debris, and live embers. The ground may contain heat pockets that can burn you or spark</pre>
          <pre> another fire.</pre>
          <pre>-Wear a NIOSH certified-respirator dusk mask and wet debris to minimize breathing in dust particles.</pre>
          <pre>-Document property damage with photographs. Conduct an inventory and contact your insurance company for assistance.</pre>
          <pre>-Wildfires can dramatically change landscape and ground conditions, which can lead to increased risk of flooding due to heavy rains,</pre>
          <pre> flash flooding, and mudflows.</pre>
