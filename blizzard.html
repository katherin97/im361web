        <h1>Blizzards</h1>
          <p>What are blizzards?</p>
          <pre>A blizzard is a storm with "considereable falling or blowing snow" and winds in excess of 35 mph, as well as visibilities of less than</pre>
          <pre>1/4 mile for at least 3 hours.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Whay are they dangerous?</p>
          <pre>Blizzards are dangerous as they can create life-threatening conditions. Driving can become difficult or even impossible due to "whiteout"</pre>
          <pre>conditions and drifting snow. Strong winds and cold temperatures also create another danger. Especially in the Midwest, where wind chills</pre>
          <pre>can be below -65F, frostbite and hypothermia can set in fast. Blizzards can also cause power outages and pipes to freeze.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Types of blizzards</p>
          <pre> - Snowstorm-Type Blizzard: this is the "traditional" blizzard. This means that it will often include heavy snowfall and below-freezing</pre>
          <pre>   temps. What makes it a blizzard is the winds of at least 35 mph.</pre>
          <pre> - Ground Blizzard: this differs from a traditional blizzard, in that there is no snowfall. This occurs when high winds blow the snow</pre>
          <pre>   that has already fallen.</pre>
          <pre> - Lake-Effect Blizzard: these are most common along large lakes, such as the Great Lakes. These types of blizzards are rare, only because</pre>
          <pre>   lake-effect snow doesn't often rise when the wind blows too fast.</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when a Blizzard Threatens</h1>
          <p>Prepare Now</p>
          <pre>-Know your area's risk for winter storms. Extreme winter weather can leave communities without utilities or other services for long periods</pre>
          <pre> of time.</pre>
          <pre>-Prepare your home to keep out the cold with insulation, caulking, and weather striping. Learn how to keep pipes from freezing. Install and</pre>
          <pre> test smoke alarms and carbon monozide detecters with battery backups.</pre>
          <pre>-Pay attention to weather reports and warnings of freezing weather and winter storms.</pre>
          <pre>-Gather supplies in case you need to stay home for several days without power.</pre>
          <pre>-Create an emergency supply kit for you car. Include jumper cables, sand, a flashlight, warm clothes, blankets, bottled water, and non-perishable</pre>
          <pre> snacks. Keep the gas tank full.</pre>
          <pre>-Learn the signs of, and basic treatments for, frostbite and hypothermia.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Survive During</p>
          <pre>-Stay off roads if at all possible. If trapped in your car, then stay inside.</pre>
          <pre>-Limit your time outside. If youu need to go outside, then wear layers of warm clothing.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Only use generators and grills outdoors and away from windows. Never heat your home with a gas stovetop</pre>
          <pre> or oven.</pre>
          <pre>-Reduce the risk of a heart attack. Avoid overexertion when shoveling snow.</pre>
          <pre>-Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia and begin treatment right away.</pre>
          <pre>-Check on neighbors. Older adults and young children are more at risk in extreme cold.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Recognize and Respond</p>
          <pre>-Frostbite causes loss of feeling and color around the face, fingers, and toes.</pre>
          <pre> - Signs: Numbness, white or grayish-yellow skin, firm or waxy skin.</pre>
          <pre> - Actions: Go to a warm room. Soak in warm water. Use body heat to warm. Do not massage or use a heating pad.</pre>
          <pre>-Hypothermia is a unusually low body temperature. A temperature below 95 degrees is an emergency.</pre>
          <pre> - Signs: Shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech, or drowsiness.</pre>
          <pre> - Actions: Go to a warm room. Warm to center of the body first: chest, neck, head, and groin. Keep dry and wrapped in warm blankets,</pre>
          <pre>   including the head and neck.</pre>
