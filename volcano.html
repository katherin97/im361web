        <h1>Volcanoes</h1>
          <p>What are volcanoes?</p>
          <pre>Volcanoes are an opening in Earth's crust that allows molten rock to reach the surface. The molten rock is called magma while it</pre>
          <pre>is below the surface, but called lava once a volcano erupts.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Where are they common?</p>
          <pre>Most volcanoes are common along the Pacific Ocean, in an area that is referred to as the "Ring of Fire". This is due too the fact</pre>
          <pre>that the Pacific Plate is surrounded by a number of continental plates. The movement of these plates create zones of subduction,</pre>
          <pre>where one plate is forced under the other. This causes the formatioon of volcanoes, and the occurance of earthquakes.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Types of volcanoes</p>
          <pre>There are 4 major types of volcanoes:</pre>
          <pre> - Cinder Cone Volcanoes: the simplest of volcano. They occur when particles and blobs of lava are ejected from a volcanic vent.</pre>
          <pre>   Over time, this builds up in a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a bowl-shaped crater at the top.</pre>
          <pre> - Composite Volcanoes: or stratovolcanoes make up some of the world's most memorable mountains: Mount Rainier, Moutn Fuji, and</pre>
          <pre>   Mount Cotopaxi. These volcanoes has a conduit system inside them that channel magma from deep within the Earth.</pre>
          <pre> - Shield Volcanoes: are large, broad volcanoes that look like shiels from above. The lava that flows out from these in thin,</pre>
          <pre>   so it can travel for great distances.</pre>
          <pre> - Lava Domes: are created by small masses of lava which are too thick to flow very far. The dome grows by expansion of the lava</pre>
          <pre>   within, and the mountain forms from material spilling off the sides.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Active Volcanoes</p>
          <pre>In the world today, there are potentially 1,500 active volcanoes, not counting the continuous belt of volcanoes on the ocean floor.</pre>
          <pre>Out of all of these, about 500 of them have erupted in historical time, with many of them being located in the "Ring of Fire".</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when a Volcano Threatens</h1>
          <p>Prepare Now</p>
          <pre>-Know you area's risk for volcanic eruption.</pre>
          <pre>-Ask local emergency management for evacuation and shelter plans, and for potential means of protection from ash.</pre>
          <pre>Learn about community warning systems.</pre>
          <pre>-Get necessary supplies in advance in case you have to evacuate immediately, or if services are cut off.</pre>
          <pre>-Consult your doctor if you have existing respiratory difficulties.</pre>
          <pre>-Practice a communication and evacuation plan with everyone in your family.</pre>
          <pre>-Have a shelter-in-place if your biggest risk is from ash.</pre>
          <pre>-Have important documents in a safe place. Create password-protected digital copies.</pre>
          <pre>-Find out what your homeowner's insurance policy will cover when a volcano erupts.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Survive During</p>
          <pre>-Listen to alerts. The Volcano Notification Service provides up-to-date information about eruptions.</pre>
          <pre>-Follow evacuation orders from local authorities. Evacuate early.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid areas downwind, and river valleys downstream, of the volcano. Rubble and ash will be carried by wind and gravity.</pre>
          <pre>-Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are if you have enough supplies. Covere ventilation openings and seal doors</pre>
          <pre> and windows.</pre>
          <pre>-If outside, protect yourself from falling ash that can irritate skin and injure breathing passages, eyes, and open wounds. Use a</pre>
          <pre> well-fitting, certified facemask such as an N95.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid driving in heavy ash fall.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Be Safe After</p>
          <pre>-Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and friends. Phone systems are often busy after a disaster.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid driving in heavy ash. Driving will stir up volcanic ash that can clog engines and stall vehicles.</pre>
          <pre>-If you have breathing problems, avoid contact with ash. Stay indoors until authorities say it is safe to go outside.</pre>
          <pre>-Do not get on your roof to remove ash unless you have guidance or training. If you have to remove ash, then be very careful as ash</pre>
          <pre> makes surfaces slippery. Be careful not to contribute additional weight to an overloaded roof.</pre>
