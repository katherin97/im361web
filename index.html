      <h2>Tornadoes</h2>
        <h3>What are tornadoes?</h3>
          <p>Tornadoes are vertical funnels of rapidly spinning air. They are born in thunderstorms and are often accompanied by hail, with giant, persistent thunderstorms called supercells being known to spawn the most destructive tornadoes.</p>
          <img scr="images/T_Formation.jpg">
          <br>
        <h3>What causes tornadoes?</h3>
          <p>Tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides with cold, dry air. When the denser cold air is pushed over the warm air, thunderstorms are produced. When the warm air rises through the colder air, it causes an updraft that will begin to rotate if winds vary in speed or direction.</p>
          <p>The rotating updraft, which is called a mesocycle, draws in more warm air from the thunderstorm, the rotation speed increases. The cold air from the jet stream provides more energy, and water from the moist air helps form the funnel cloud. Once the funnel cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.</p>
          <br>
        <h3>Where are they common?</h3>
          <p>While tornadoes can happen anywhere, they are most common in the Great Plains, otherwise known as Tornado Alley. This is caused by the cold, dry air coming down from Canada meeting the warm, moist air traveling from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

        <h3>Enhanced Fujita Scale</h3>
      <h2>How to Stay Safe when a Tornado Threatens</h2>
        <h3>Prepare Now</h3>
          <p>-Know your area's tornado rise. In the U.S., the midwest and the Southeast have a greater rise for tornadoes.</p>
          <p>-Know the signs of a tornado, including a rotatins, funnel-shaped cloud; an approaching cloud of debris; or a loud roar-similar to a freight train.</p>
          <p>-Pay attention to weather repoorts. Meterologists can predict when conditions might be right for a tornado.</p>
          <br>
        <h3>Survive During</h3>
          <p>-Immediately go to a safe location that you have identified.</p>
          <p>-Take additional cover by sheilding your head and neck with your arms, as well sa putting furniture and blankets around you.</p>
          <p>-Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or your local alert system for current emergency information.</p>
          <p>-Do not try to outrun a tornado in your vehicle.</p>
          <p>-If you are in a car or outdoors, and cannot get to a building, cover your head and neck with your arms and cover your body with a coat or blanket.</p>
          <br>
        <h3>Be Safe After</h3>
          <pr>-Keep listening to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or your local authorities for information.</p>
          <p>-If you are trapped, cover your mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing in dust.</p>
          <p>-Stay clear of fallen power lines or broken utility lines.</p>
          <p>-Do not enter damaged buildings until you are told that they are safe.</p>
          <p>-Save your phone calls for emergencies. Use text messages or social media to communicate with family or friends, as phone services are either down or busy after a disaster.</p>
          <p>-Be careful during clean-up. Wear thick-soled shoes, long pants, and work gloves.</p>
