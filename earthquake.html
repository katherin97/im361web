        <h1>Earthquake</h1>
          <p>What are earthquakes?</p>
          <pre>An earthquake happens when two tectonic plates slip past one another. The location below the earth's surface where the earthquake</pre>
          <pre>starts is called the hypocenter, with the location above on the surface called the epicenter.</pre>
          <pre>Before an earthquake, there are sometimes foreshocks, which happen in the same place the larger earthquake will occur. The largest,</pre>
          <pre>main earthquake is called the mainshock, with the aftershocks that always follow. And depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks</pre>
          <pre>can continue for weeks, months, and in some cases, years.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Where do they occur?</p>
          <pre>Most earthquakes occur along the edge of oceanic and continental plates. The earth's crust is made up of several pieces, called</pre>
          <pre>plates, that are moved around by the mantle, which lies under the crust. As these plates move, they are bumping, pulling apart,</pre>
          <pre>or sliding past one another. An earthquake will occur when two plates either bump into or slide past one another.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>How are they recorded?</p>
          <pre>Earthquakes are recorded using a seismograph consists of a mass attached to a fixed base, so, during an earthquake, the base moves</pre>
          <pre>and the mass does not. The motion of the base moving in respect to the mass is transformed into an electrical voltage, which is either</pre>
          <pre>recorded on paper, magnetic tape, or another recording medium.</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when an Earthquake Threatens</h1>
          <p>Prepare Now</p>
          <pre>-Secure items, such as TV's, and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves.</pre>
          <pre>-Practice Drop, Cover, then Hold On with family and coworkers. Drop to your hands and knees, cover your head and neck with your arms.</pre>
          <pre> Crawl only as far as needed to reach cover from falling materials, and hold onto any sturdy furniture until the shaking stops.</pre>
          <pre>-Create a family emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state contact, and plan where to meet if you get separated.</pre>
          <pre>-Consider obtaining an earthquake insurancee policy. Standard homeowner's insurance does not cover earthquake damage.</pre>
          <pre>-Consider a retrofit your building to correct structural issues that make is vulnerable to collapse during an earthquake.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Survive During</p>
          <pre>-Drop, Cover, then Hold On like you practiced.</pre>
          <pre>-If in bed, stay there and cover your head and beck with a pillow.</pre>
          <pre>-If inside, stay there until the shaking stops. DO NOT run outside.</pre>
          <pre>-If in a vehicle, stop in a clear area that is away from buildings, trees, overpasses, or utility wires.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are in ahigh-rise building, expect fire alarms and sprinklers to go off. DO NOT use elevators.</pre>
          <pre>-If near slopes, cliffs, or mountains, be alert for falling rocks and landslides.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Be Safe After</p>
          <pre>-Expect aftershocks to follow the largest shock of an earthquake.</pre>
          <pre>-Check yourself for injury and provide assistance to others if yoou have training.</pre>
          <pre>-If in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building.</pre>
          <pre>-DO NOT enter damaged buildings.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are trapped, cover your mouth.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are in an area that experiences tsunamis, go inland or to higher ground immediately after the shaking stops.</pre>
          <pre>-Save phone calls for emergencies.</pre>
          <pre>-Once safe, monitor local news reports via battery operated radio, TV, social media, or cell phone text alerts for emergency</pre>
          <pre> information and instructions.</pre>
          <pre>-Use extreme caution during post-disaster clean-up buildings and around debris. Do not attemp to remove heavy debris by yourself.</pre>
          <pre> Wear protective clothing, including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work gloves, and sturdy, thick-soled shoes during clean-up.</pre>
