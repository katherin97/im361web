        <h1>Floods</h1>
          <p>What are floods?</p>
          <pre>Flooding is an overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. They can occur during heavy rains, when open waves come on shore,</pre>
          <pre>when snow melts too fast, or when a dam breaks. THey can either occur quickly, or over a long period of time. The most dangerous kind</pre>
          <pre>of flooding is flash floods, as they combine both speed and unpredictability.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Areas at risk of flash flooding</p>
          <pre>Densly populated areas are at a high risk, as buildings, highways, driveways, and parking lots increase runoff.</pre>
          <pre>Areas near rivers are at risk, though leaves are often built along rivers to help prevent high water from floowing bording land. Though,</pre>
          <pre>there have been instances when these leaves have failed, resulting in devastating flash flooding.</pre>
          <pre>Dam failures can send a sudden destructive wall of water downstream, resulting in feet of water floosing downstream.</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when a Flood Threatens</h1>
          <p>Prepare Now</p>
          <pre>-Know types of flood risks in your area.</pre>
          <pre>-Sign up for your communities warning system.</pre>
          <pre>-If flash flooding is a risk in your location, then monitor potential signs, such as heavy rain.</pre>
          <pre>-Gather supplies in case you have to leave immediately, or if services are cut off.</pre>
          <pre>-Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect, but it can protect the life</pre>
          <pre> you've built.</pre>
          <pre>-Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.</pre>
          <pre>-Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters, install check valves, and consider a sump pump</pre>
          <pre> with a battery.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Survive During</p>
          <pre>-Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to a safe location that you previously identified.</pre>
          <pre>-If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades, local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of</pre>
          <pre> flooded areas.</pre>
          <pre>-Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don't Drown!</pre>
          <pre>-Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.</pre>
          <pre>-If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, then stay inside. If water is rising inside the vehicle, then seek refuge on the roof.</pre>
          <pre>-If trapped in a building, then go to it's highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater.</pre>
          <pre> Go on the roof only necessary. Once there, signal for help.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Be Safe After</p>
          <pre>-Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid driving, except in emergencies.</pre>
          <pre>-Snakes and other animals may be in your house. Wear heavy gloaves and boots during clean up.</pre>
          <pre>-Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water.</pre>
          <pre>-Acoid wading in floodwater, which and contain dangerous debris and be contaminated.</pre>
          <pre>-Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.</pre>
