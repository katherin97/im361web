        <h1>Droughts</h1>
          <p>What are droughts?</p>
          <pre>Droughts are periods of abnormally dry and precipitation-less weather. A misconception is that droughts are brought on by periods of no</pre>
          <pre>rain or snow, and while this is common, the onset of a drought may be less noticeable. If snow or rain is in lighter amounts, such as a</pre>
          <pre>drizzle here and flurries there, instead of a steady rain or snow showers, this can also be an indication a drought is on its way.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>How droughts hurt</p>
          <pre> - Economic Impacts: this includes the loss of timber, agriculture, and fisheries. This can cause an increase in food prices, and in</pre>
          <pre>   less developed countries, famine can become a problem.</pre>
          <pre> - Social Impacts: increased chance of conflict over commodities, fertile land, and water resources. It can also include abandonment of</pre>
          <pre>   cultural traditions, loss of homelands, changes in lifestyle, and increased chance of health risks.</pre>
          <pre> - Environmental Impacts: loss is species biodiversity, migration changes, reduced air quality, and increased soil erosion.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Types of droughts</p>
          <pre> - Hydrological Drought: watersheds experience depleted amounts of avaliable water. Lack of water in rivers and resevoirs can impact</pre>
          <pre>   hydroelectric power companies, farmers, wildlife, and communities.</pre>
          <pre> - Meterological Drought: a lack of precipitation is the most common definition of a drought.</pre>
          <pre> - Agricultural Drought: when soil moisture becomes a problem. Shortages in precipication, changes in evapotranspiration, and reduced</pre>
          <pre>   ground water levels can create stress and poblems for crops.</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when a Drought Threatens</h1>
          <p>Indoor Water Conservation Tips Prior to a Drought</p>
          <pre>General</pre>
          <pre> - Never pour water down the drain when there are may be another use for it.</pre>

          <pre> - Check all plumbing for leaks and have any leaks repaired by a plumber.</pre>

          <pre> - Install an instant hot water heater in your sink.</pre>
          <pre> - Insulate a water-softening systen only when the minterals in the water would damage your pipes. Turn the softener off while on vacation.</pre>
          <pre> - Choose appliances that are more energy and water efficient.</pre>
          <pre>Bathroom</pre>

          <pre> - Install a taoilet displacement device to cut down on the amount of water needed to flush. Place a one-gallon just of water into the tank</pre>
          <pre>   to displace toilet flow.</pre>
          <pre> - Replace your shower head with an ultra-low-flow version.</pre>

          <p>Outdoor Water Conservation Tips Prior to a Drought</p>
          <pre>General</pre>
          <pre> - Check your well pump periodically. If the automatic pump turns on and off while water is not being used, you have a leak.</pre>
          <pre> - Plant native and/or drought-tolerant grasses, ground covers, shrubs, and trees. Group plants together based on similar water needs.</pre>
          <pre> - Install irrigation devices that are the most water efficient for each use, such as micro and drip irrigation, and soaker hoses.</pre>
          <pre> - Use mulch to retain moisture in the soil.</pre>
          <pre> - Avoid purchasing recreational water toys that require a constant stream of water.</pre>
          <pre> - Avoid installing ornamental water features unless they use recirculated water.</pre>
          <pre> - Consider rainwater harvesting where pratical.</pre>
          <pre> - Contact your local water provider for information and assistance.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Indoor Water Conservation Tips While in a Drought</p>
          <pre>Bathroom</pre>
          <pre> - Avoid flushing the toilet unnecessarily. Dispose of tissues, insects, and other similar waste in the trash rather than the toliet.</pre>
          <pre> - Avoid taking baths-take short showers-turn on the water only to get wet and lather, and then again to rinse off.</pre>
          <pre> - Avoid letting the water run while brishing your teeth, washing your face or shaving.</pre>
          <pre> - Place a bucket in the shower to catch excess water for watering plants.</pre>
          <pre>Kitchen</pre>
          <pre> - Operate automatic dishwashers only when they are fully loaded.</pre>
          <pre> - Hand wash dishes by filling two containers-one with soapy water and the other with rinse water containing a small amount of chlroine bleach.</pre>
          <pre> - Clean vegetables in a pan filled with water rather then running water from the tap.</pre>
          <pre> - Store drinking water in the refrigerator. Do not let the tap run while waiting for water to cool down.</pre>
          <pre> - Avoid wasting water waiting for it to get hot, capture it for other uses.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Outdoor Water Conservation Tips While in a Drought</p>
          <pre>Lawn Care</pre>
          <pre> - Avoid over watering your lawn and water only when needed.</pre>
          <pre> - Check the soil moisture levels with a soul probe, spade, or large screwdriver. You don't need to water if the soil is still moist.</pre>
          <pre> - If your lawn does require watering, do so when the temperature in cool.</pre>
          <pre> - Water in several short sessions, rather than one large one, in order for your lawn to better absorb moisture and avoid runoff.</pre>
