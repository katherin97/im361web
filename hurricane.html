        <h1>Hurricanes</h1>
          <p>What are hurricanes?</p>
          <pre>Hurricanes are large, swelling storms that form over warm ocean waters. When a hurricane reaches land, it pushes a wall of</pre>
          <pre>ocean water, called a storm surge, ashore. The storm surge and heavy rain from a hurricane can cause flooding.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>How does a storm become a hurricane</p>
          <pre>A hurricane starts out as a tropical distrubance. This is an area over warm ocean waters where rain clouds are building.</pre>
          <pre>A tropical distrubance sometimes grows into a tropical depression. This is an area of rotating thunderstorms with winds</pre>
          <pre>of 62 km/hr (38 mph).</pre>
          <pre>A tropical depression becomes a tropical storm if its winds reach 63 km/hr (39 mph).</pre>
          <pre>A tropical storm becomes a hurricane if its winds reach 119 km/hr (74 mph).</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Parts of a hurricane</p>
          <pre> - Eye: the eye is the "hole" at the center of the storm. Winds are light in this area. Skies are partly cloudy, and</pre>
          <pre>   sometimes even clear.</pre>
          <pre> - Eye Wall: the eye wall is a ring of thunderstorms. These storms swirl around the eye. The wall is where winds are</pre>
          <pre>   strongest and rain is heaviest.</pre>
          <pre> - Rain Bands: bands of clouds and rain go far out from the hurricane's eye wall. These bands stretch for hundreds of miles.</pre>
          <pre>   They contain thunderstorms and sometimes tornadoes.</pre>
          <br></br>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe when a Hurricane Threatens</h1>
          <p>Prepare Now</p>
          <pre>-Know your area's rick of hurricanes.</pre>
          <pre>-If you are at risk for flash flooding, watch for warning signs such as heavy rain.</pre>
          <pre>-Based on your location and community plans, make your own plans for evacuation or sheltering in place.</pre>
          <pre>-Become familiar with you evacuation zone, the evacuation route, and shelter locations.</pre>
          <pre>-Gather needed supplies for at least three days. Keep in mind each person's specific needs, as well as pets.</pre>
          <pre>-Keep important documents in a safe place or create password-protected digital copies.</pre>
          <pre>-Protect your property. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves in plumbing to prevent backups. Consider hurricane</pre>
          <pre> shutters and review insurance policies.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>When a hurricane is 18-36 hours from arriving</p>
          <pre>-Bookmark your city or county website for quick access to storm updates and emergency instructions.</pre>
          <pre>-Bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds; and trim or remove trees close enough to</pre>
          <pre> fall on the building.</pre>
          <pre>-Cover you're home's windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>When a hurricane is 6-18 hours from arriving</p>
          <pre>-Turn on your TV/radio, or check your city/county website every 30 minutes in order to get the latest weather updates and</pre>
          <pre> emergency instructions.</pre>
          <pre>-Charge your cell phone now so you will have a full battery in case you lose power.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>When a hurricane is 6 houors from arriving</p>
          <pre>-If you're not in an area recommended for evacuation, plan to stay at home or where you are and let friends and family know</pre>
          <pre> where you are.</pre>
          <pre>-Close storm shutters and stay away from windows. Flying glass from broken windows could injure you.</pre>
          <pre>-Turn your refrigerator or freezer to the coldest setting and open only when necessary. Keep a thermometer in the refrigerator</pre>
          <pre> to be able to check the food temperature when the power is restored.</pre>
          <pre>-Turn on your TV/radio, or check your city/county website every 30 minutes in order to get the latest weather updats and</pre>
          <pre> emergency instructions.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Survive During</p>
          <pre>-If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Do not drive around barricades.</pre>
          <pre>-If sheltering during high winds, go to a FEMA safe room, ICC 500 storm shelter, or a small, interior, windowless room or hallway</pre>
          <pre> on the lowest floor that is not subject to flooding.</pre>
          <pre>-If trapped in a building by flooding, go the highest level of the building. Do not climb into closed attic. You may become trapped</pre>
          <pre> by rising flood water.</pre>
          <pre>-Listen for current emergency information and instructions.</pre>
          <pre>-Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery outdoors ONLY and away from windows.</pre>
          <pre>-Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Just six inches of fast-moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving</pre>
          <pre> water can sweep your vehicle away.</pre>
          <pre>-Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.</pre>
          <br></br>

          <p>Be Safe After</p>
          <pre>-Listen to authorities for information and special instructions.</pre>
          <pre>-Be careful during clean-up. Wear protective clothing and work with someone else.</pre>
          <pre>-Do not touch electrical equipment if it wet of if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off electricity at the</pre>
          <pre> main breaker or fuse box to prevent electric shock.</pre>
          <pre>-Avoid wading in flood water, which can contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.</pre>
          <pre>-Save phone calls for emergencies. Use text messages or social media to communicate with family and friends.</pre>
          <pre>-Document any property damage with photographs. Contact your insurance company for assistance.</pre>
